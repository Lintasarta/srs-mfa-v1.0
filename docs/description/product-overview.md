# Product Overview

The ai.cloudeka.id service portal currently relies solely on email verification for user authentication. This document outlines the requirements for an enhancement to the existing authentication system, introducing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to bolster security and compliance. The **"Service Portal MFA Enhancement"** project aims to provide a more robust security layer for user logins.

This MFA implementation will be **mandatory for Super Admin users**, ensuring a higher level of security for critical administrative accounts. For User Admin accounts, MFA will be **optional**, providing flexibility while still offering the option for enhanced security. The primary goal is to enhance the overall security posture of the ai.cloudeka.id platform and meet evolving compliance standards.

The MFA system will primarily leverage Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) generated by authenticator applications (such as Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator) through QR code scanning or manual key setup. An email-based authentication method will also be available as an automatic fallback, particularly during user onboarding.
